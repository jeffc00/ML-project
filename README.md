One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.  

In this project, our goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and train a model to predict the manner in which the exercise was done.
